  <div class="col-12">
    <p>
      Research and development of systems that involve <b>natural language understanding</b> and <b>knowledge</b>.
      Previously, worked on systems software, including research on <b>operating systems</b>, <b>computer architecture</b>,
      <b>distributed systems</b> and <b>cloud computing</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am a <a href="https://research.google/people/104996/">Software Engineer at Google Research</a>,
      where I work with the <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/language/">Google Research Language team</a>.
      Previously, I was a Research Staff Member at IBM Watson Group as well as at IBM Research. I worked on the 
      <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2890548">Watson Concept Insights></a> cloud service, having co-founded
      the research project and later serving as lead software engineer and system architect.
      <br>
      I received a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto in 2012, advised by
      <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~stumm/">Prof. Michael Stumm</a>. For my Ph.D., I invented and developed mechanisms
      to improve the performance of network and I/O applications, operating systems and run-time systems.

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px;"><b>Natural Language Understanding at Google Research</b> (2016 - present)</h4>

    Working on a variety of projects related to Natural Language Understanding at Google Research (NYC). In conjunction with Google Cloud teams, extended language support for syntatic and entity analysis from three initial languages to eleven. Also worked internally to improve quality of entity recognition, entity typing and entity linking.

    More recently, I have been working on information extraction and knowledge graphs, specifically learning how to generate neural representations of information, directly from text, with minimal or no direct supervision from existing knowledge graphs.

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"><b>Service oriented peer-to-peer middleware</b> (2012-2013)</h4> 
    Researched and prototyped novel peer-to-peer distributed system with the goal of offering core services
    for the construction of service-oriented applications. The main goal of the project was to produce a suite of tools
    and micro-services to make it easier for developers to write robust, large distributed applications or cloud services.
    The project brought together a distributed key-value store with dynamic consistency and availability guarantees,
    a membership/directory service, a topology aware messaging bus, a deployment system based on Linux containers (LXC),
    and integrated with monitoring.

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"><b>Cloud management resiliency</b> (2012-2013)</h4>
    <p>
      Explored resiliency of cloud management systems, focusing on <a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>.
      Developed mechanism for monitoring and tracking distributed requests within OpenStack services. This mechanism was
      used to log specific distributed flows in the presence of faults or crashes. Extended this basic mechanism to
      introduce artificial faults at specific events, along with automatically validating expected outputs from specific
      series of requests.

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"><b>FlexSC (exception-less system calls)</b> (2010-2011)</h4>
    <p>
      Research in the area of operating systems and computer architecture, focusing on run-time performance.
      Created a novel operating system interface for traditional monolithic kernels (e.g., Linux), called
      <b>exception-less system calls</b>, that enables applications to communicate with the operating system via
      asynchronous messages. Created a new POSIX compatible threading library to support multi-threaded server applications
      to efficiently use exception-less system calls (e.g., Apache, MySQL and BIND).
      Created a new event-driven library to support explicitly asynchronous application/OS execution, and
      ported memcached and nginx to this new library. Demonstrated that exception-less system calls leads to efficient
      execution on multi-core processors.

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"><b>Runtime systems using hardware performance counter</b> (2007-2010)</h4>
    <p>
      Created tools for exploring peformance of applications, run-time and operating systems using hardware performance counters.
      The tooling and analysis I worked on allowed our research group to design novel techniques for improving utilization of processor cache.
      
      The technique I pioneered was an operating system based system for improving processor cache performance called
      <b>"software pollute buffer"</b>. This system profiles application cache performance at run-time, through hardware
      performance counters, and dynamically remaps application pages with poor cache utilization, using standard page-coloring.
      I implemented this prototype within the Linux kernel, using the hardware performance counters from a PowerPC processor.
