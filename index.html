  <div class="col-12">
    <p>
      Systems software researcher and engineer. Lately, I've been working on building large-scale <b>distributed systems</b> for
      supporting <b>machine learning based cloud services</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am a Research Staff Member at IBM Watson Group (previously at IBM Research). I work on the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/concept-insights.html"><b>Watson Concept Insights</b></a> cloud service, having co-founded the research project and later serving as lead software engineer and system architect.
      <br>
      I received a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto in 2012, advised by <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~stumm/">Prof. Michael Stumm</a>. For my Ph.D., I invented and developed mechanisms to improve the performance of network and I/O applications, operating systems and run-time systems.

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"><b>Service oriented peer-to-peer middleware</b> (2012-2013)</h4> 
    Researched and prototyped novel peer-to-peer distributed system with the goal of offering core services
    for the construction of service-oriented applications. The main goal of the project was to produce a suite of tools
    and micro-services to make it easier for developers to write robust, large distributed applications or cloud services.
    The project brought together a distributed key-value store with dynamic consistency and availability guarantees,
    a membership/directory service, a topology aware messaging bus, a deployment system based on Linux containers (LXC),
    and integrated with monitoring.

	<li>Designed and developed 6 different scale-out peer-to-peer microservices in Go.</li>
	<li>Designed and developed fully distributed in-memory key-value store with variable consistence and availability guarantees (per-collection). Collections could be configured to use fully consistent (RAFT based consensus), or fully available (peer-to-peer protocol).</li>
	<li>Designed and developed highly-available distributed DHCP service for dynamically assigning IPs to VMs and containers within a data-center</li>

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"><b>Cloud management resiliency</b> (2012-2013)</h4>
    <p>
      Explored resiliency of cloud management systems, focusing on <a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>.
      Developed mechanism for monitoring and tracking distributed requests within OpenStack services. This mechanism was
      used to log specific distributed flows in the presence of faults or crashes. Extended this basic mechanism to
      introduce artificial faults at specific events, along with automatically validating expected outputs from specific
      series of requests.

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"><b>FlexSC (exception-less system calls)</b> (2010-2011)</h4>
    <p>
      Research in the area of operating systems and computer architecture, focusing on run-time performance.
      Created a novel operating system interface for traditional monolithic kernels (e.g., Linux), called
      <b>exception-less system calls</b>, that enables applications to communicate with the operating system via
      asynchronous messages. Created a new POSIX compatible threading library to support multi-threaded server applications
      to efficiently use exception-less system calls (e.g., Apache, MySQL and BIND).
      Created a new event-driven library to support explicitly asynchronous application/OS execution, and
      ported memcached and nginx to this new library. Demonstrated that exception-less system calls leads to efficient
      execution on multi-core processors.

    <h4 class="display-4" style="font-size:20px; margin-top:20px;"><b>Runtime systems using hardware performance counter</b> (2007-2010)</h4>
    <p>
      Created tools for exploring peformance of applications, run-time and operating systems using hardware performance counters.
      The tooling and analysis I worked on allowed our research group to design novel techniques for improving utilization of processor cache.
      
      The technique I pioneered was an operating system based system for improving processor cache performance called
      <b>"software pollute buffer"</b>. This system profiles application cache performance at run-time, through hardware
      performance counters, and dynamically remaps application pages with poor cache utilization, using standard page-coloring.
      I implemented this prototype within the Linux kernel, using the hardware performance counters from a PowerPC processor.
